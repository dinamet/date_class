# date_class

Date Class project allows to check the validity of dates, if they are invalid, it can update them in order to be valid.
It can announce which the day of the week is.
It can calculate the difference between two dates.
Moreover eventually it sorts the dates in ascending order: by year, by month and by day.

User is able to write any valid date that he/she wants and get some infotmation about it.

Project was not easy for me. To be honest I used additional sourses.
